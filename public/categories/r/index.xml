      <description>Happy new year 2022!
After the vision of &amp;gt;CodeBlue and this website have been a brainchild of many years and in more concrete planning for a few months, we are excited to finally launch the site!
One big accelerator has been that Peter finally came around to learn R blogdown, which has turned out to be very well documented and therefore quick and easy to learn. We’re aware the default design isn’t exactly winning us style points, but we like it, it’s easy, and it works.</description>
