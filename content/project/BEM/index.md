In our [column with Berlin Exchange Medicine](https://journal.medicine.berlinexchange.de/codeblue), we track our journey in the world of medical research, data science and informatics. Rather than discussing specific results, we want to reflect on research practices and career paths informed by our own experiences.

Our goal is to encourage students from all fields of study to consider a career in research by lifting the curtain on our daily life and mindset. Specifically, we hope to demystify the world of science in general and data science in particular. For more details, see our [mission statement](/about/mission_statement/).
