<p>Happy new year 2022!</p>
<p>After the vision of <code>&gt;CodeBlue</code> and this website have been a brainchild of many years and in more concrete planning for a few months, we are excited to finally launch the site!</p>
<p>One big accelerator has been that Peter finally came around to learn <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown">R blogdown</a>, a fantastic package which has turned out to be very well documented and therefore quick and easy to learn. The second round of thanks belongs to the folks at <a href="https://wowchemy.com/?utm_campaign=poweredby">wowchemy</a> whose tools and templates this is based on. If you want to build your own website like this, read <a href="https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/">this blogdown post</a> or look at the <a href="https://github.com/codeblue-team/codeblue.it">repository</a> we keep the source code for this website in.</p>
<p>We are happy to cooperate with <a href="/project/bem/">Berlin Exchange Medicine</a> where we have a regular column. In addition, we plan to add to this blog at least somewhat regularly. Happy reading!</p>
<p>Peter and Till</p>
