Between a father in software and a physician mother, Peter decided to study medicine at RWTH Aachen. Not to make his father feel left out, he started a data science-heavy thesis at the Fintelmann lab at Massachusetts General Hospital & Harvard Medical School in 2019 and is now heading its algorithms & software development team.
